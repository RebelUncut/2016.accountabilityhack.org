			Accountability Hack Pre-event session is being held in the Boothroyd Room of Portcullis House from 6:30 to 8pm on 10th November.  
			
			Parliament, the NAO and the ONS will each explain their challenge, as well as introduce their data in the hope of sparking ideas and interesting conversations in preparation for the event. We'll also look to explore prototypes that have been built using their data, as well as previous winners of Accountability Hack. 

			The meetup is also a chance for you to meet your fellow developers, while exploring the types of projects you might like to work on at this year's event.
