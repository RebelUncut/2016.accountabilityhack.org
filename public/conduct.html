      <h1 class="page-title">Code of Conduct</h1>
      <article><p>Accountability Hack 2016 will be following the Hack Code of Conduct as set out at <a href="http://hackcodeofconduct.org/">http://hackcodeofconduct.org/</a> Visit the Code online to show your support.</p>
<p>All attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff at Accountability Hack 2016 are required to agree with the following code of conduct. The organising team will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>
<h2 id="the-quick-version">The Quick Version</h2>
<p>The team behind Accountability Hack 2016 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous hackathon attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at Accountability Hack 2016, or in any online channels or social media associated with the event. Accountability Hack 2016 participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the organising team.</p>
<h2 id="the-less-quick-version">The Less Quick Version</h2>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at Accountability Hack 2016 are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.
Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Accountability Hack 2016 organising team immediately.</p>
<p>The Accountability Hack 2016 team will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. <strong>We value your attendance</strong>.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the Accountability Hack 2016 organising team may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hack, or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at Accountability Hack 2016 to ensure safety, serenity and quite simply the most awesome event for all.</p>

      <h1 class="page-title">Personal Data Consent</h1>
      <article><p>Rebel Labs and sponsors of Accountability Hack 2016 use photographs and videos to illustrate a range of promotional material. These materials include both digital and hardcopy products, used across a variety of platforms including social media, printed collateral and exhibition stands. Additionally, we may also interview people who have an interesting or inspiring story to tell. This editorial supports our products and policies.</p>
<p>Before we can solicit an interview, take a photograph or video, we need to be given consent which indicates that you or the person you have legal responsibility for is happy for us to proceed.

<h2 id="who-needs-to-give-consent-">Who needs to give consent?</h2>
<p>Children aged 11 years and under must have a parent or a guardian give their consent.</p>
<p>Young people aged between 12 and 16 inclusive can give their own consent. However, it is wise to get additional consent from their parent or guardian as well.</p>
<p>All persons aged 17 and over can give consent for themselves, as long as they are not considered to be part of a vulnerable group.</p>
<p>An individual who is considered to be part of a vulnerable group as described in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 c47 must provide consent from their legal guardian. Full details of the Act can be found <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/47/contents">http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/47/contents</a>. </p>
<h2 id="what-you-are-agreeing-to-">What you are agreeing to?</h2>
<p>By consenting to this policy as part of your registration for Accountability Hack 2016, you give your agreement for the individual named to be photographed, filmed and interviewed, and that the materials produced as a result may contain personal data (which we will simply call &quot;your data&quot;).</p>
<p>Your agreement gives Rebel Labs and event sponsors the right to include your data in products which may range in media types, and may include digital media and commercial and educational magazines.</p>
