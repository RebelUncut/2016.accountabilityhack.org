		:marked
			Accountability Hack has become a stalwart of the UK Civic Tech calendar, returning this year once again as a key event during Parliament Week 2016. 


			At Accountability Hack participants are given the challenge to use government data to ideate new and innovative ways in which the people can become involved in the democratic process. 


			The weekend is also an opportunity to get political support and buy in, give feedback on the state of the data, and ultimately aims to produce projects that will hold our elected more accountable.

		ul
			li
				h2 What is Accountability Hack?
				p Accountability Hack is an annual, two day event bringing together the civic tech community in the UK. The aim of the weekend is to form teams and create applications using open government data to better hold our elected to account. You might come to Accountability Hack 2016 if you are a developer, designer, UXer, researcher, data lover, public sector worker, school or university student, armchair enthusiast or simply an interested bystander. 
			li
				h2 Isn't hacking bad?
				p In this context, hacking means building apps, websites and services really quickly to prove the value in an idea. Nothing malicious, nothing illegal.
			li
				h2 I don't have a team
				p You don’t need a team to take part; it’s perfectly acceptable to create a solo project. However, at the informal pre-event meetup and the event itself, there will be opportunities to share ideas and connect with your fellow developers to form a team. As organisers, we’ll do our best to encourage and facilitate teamwork across the weekend.
			li
				h2 Can I attend if I'm <18?
				p Yes, under 18s are very welcome to attend Accountability Hack and there will be appropriate measures in place to ensure your safety across the event - namely multiple DBS checked volunteers, at least two of whom will chaperone the u18s sleeping area. However, if you are 11 or under you must be accompannied by a parent or guardian.
			li
				h2 Can I stay overnight?
				p Absolutely! We’ll have separate sleeping areas for over 18s and under 18s. Attendees aged 12-15 will be chaperoned by two DBS checked volunteers overnight. Attendees aged 11 or under must have their parent or guardian stay with them. If you're staying, you'll need to bring a sleeping bag/mat.
			li
				h2 What's the deal with food?
				p All food across the weekend will be provided. That is: breakfast and lunch on Saturday and Sunday, as well as dinner on Saturday evening. Breakfast will be continental, and Saturday dinner is TBC. All dietary requirements will be considered and catered for - <b>please make sure you provide this information upon registering</b>.
			li
				h2 Who owns the projects?
				p All IP generated at Accountability Hack belongs to the developer. However, to generate the widest benefit from this event, we encourage developers to provide Open Source licenses for the results of their creativity.
			li
				h2 Can I start before?
				p While you can explore ideas before the Accountability Hack weekend and produce designs, you cannot write a line of code for your project before the event itself.
			li
				h2 What shall I bring?
				p All participants will need to bring their laptop, charger(s) and any other devices they wish to work on. If you are staying overnight, you will also need to bring a sleeping bag. 
			li
				h2 What is open data?
				p Open data is any data which is freely available with a license which allows reuse and redistribution. Please respect attribution requirements.
			li
				h2 My question isn't covered
				p No problem! Get in touch with #[a(href="mailto:hello@rebellabs.co.uk") hello@rebellabs.co.uk]
